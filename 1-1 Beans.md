# Beans
	I rummaged through the debris, holding put hope for some kind of sustenance to quell the aching in my belly. It had been a few days since I had found food. I felt myself growing weaker. Anything edible would do, but I had began to give up hope that my current search would yield anything of value. 

	I irritably threw a molded old garment aside. I was on the verge of attempting to sleep the hunger away. But, there it was, and old dented can of green beans. I had never been a picky eater, but that is unsurprising considering considering my living conditions.

	I was ecstatic for the beans. I stood up in a rush, salivating for the nourishment the can promised.  As I looked up from the can, I came to a horrible realization.  I had no way of opening it.
